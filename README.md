## Requirements
To be able to run the Jupyter notebook, you will need to set up [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and then launch Jupyter notebook, then search for the python-lists-not-scary repository that you just downloaded, navigate to the folder, and finally run the notebook.

## Newbies
If you don't feel like setting up Anaconda, you can still benefit from reading the notebook, or typing its content into your usual Python interpreter.
